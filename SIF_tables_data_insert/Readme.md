# Explanation of Insert Data folder and files

SQL scripts here have filenames that each align with one table from **"Drop-then-Create-SIF-tables.sql"**.
They perform a full insert of data, into one target SIF table, each.

The "xxx.yyy" filename prefix gives the recommended order in which  to complete the mappings, and documents the dependency order in which data insert must occur.
These filenames are generated with an Excel formula in "tables list" (stored in the Select Only folder).

The "tables list" files track all the scripts to be built, and *(with "xxx.yyy" filename prefix)* recommends the order in which  to complete the mappings, and documents the dependency order in which data insert must occur.

## Current state of mapping

See the in the "Select Only" folder (Excel file, csv, and Readme).
